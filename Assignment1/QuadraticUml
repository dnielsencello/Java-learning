Design
    -Create three user inputs for the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
        -inputs are a, b, and c

    -Calculate the roots of the given quadratic equation using the following equations
        R1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/ 2*a
        R2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/ 2*a

    - Use the following discriminant to determine if the number of roots
        b^2 - 4*a*c
            - if positive, the equation has two roots
                - out put message: "There are two roots for the quadratic equation with these coefficients"
                - output R1 and R2
            - if zero, the equation has one root
                - output message: "There is one root for the quadratic equation with these coefficients
                - output R1
            - if negative, the equation has no real root
                - out put message: "There are no roots for the quadratic equation with these coefficients
Testing
    - Had problems with "^" when trying to square a value
Implementation
    - looks good
